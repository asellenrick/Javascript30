# Javascript30

Wes Bos has a great free course called the [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I thought it would be fun to follow along with the course and learn a few things. All of his starting files were used but I did write the remaining code myself and even added some functionality to some of them. 

~~I'm still working on completing all 30 and will follow up with some things I learned along the way.~~ 
I've completed all of the projects and I've learned quite a few things about JS and myself.

- I like structure (getting up and doing something challenging every morning).
- I there are a lot of JS APIs that aren't as scary as they sound. (thanks SpeechSynthesisUtterance)
- Most of the JS APIs I thought weren't supported enough in the browser to use really are.
- Using map, join and template strings to generate innerHTML is sweet!
