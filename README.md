# Javascript30

Wes Bos has a great free course called the [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I thought it would be fun to follow along with the course and learn a few things. All of his starting files were used but I did write the remaining code myself and even added some functionality to some of them. 

I'm still working on completing all 30 and will follow up with some things I learned along the way.
